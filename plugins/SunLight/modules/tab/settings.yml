  # This option does NOT affect player sorting in tablist!
  # To make tablist sorted by player ranks you MUST setup 'Nametags' option!
  # This is just how the game works.
  #
  # If multiple name formats are available for a player, the one with the greatest priority will be used.
  # If no name format is available for a player, the one labeled 'default' will be used (if present).
