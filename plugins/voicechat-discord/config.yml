# To add a bot, just copy paste the following into bots:
#
# bots:
# - token: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
#   vc_id: VOICE_CHANNEL_ID_HERE
#
# Example for 2 bots:
#
# bots:
# - token: MyFirstBotsToken
#   vc_id: 1234567890123456789
# - token: MySecondBotsToken
#   vc_id: 9876543210987654321
#
# If you are only using 1 bot, just replace DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your bot's token and replace VOICE_CHANNEL_ID_HERE with the voice channel ID.
#
# By default, Simple Voice Chat Discord Bridge will check for a new update on server startup. If it finds
# a new update, it will always log this to the console, but as long as `alert_ops_of_updates` is true, it
# will also tell any operators that there is an update available when they join the server.
# We highly recommend you keep `alert_ops_of_updates` on since it is very important that you update the mod/plugin
# as soon as updates come out due to bugs popping up randomly.
#
# If you are reporting an issue or trying to figure out what's causing an issue, you may find the `debug_level` option helpful.
# It will enable debug logging according to the level:
# - 0 (or lower): No debug logging
# - 1: Some debug logging (mainly logging that won't spam the console but can be helpful)
# - 2: Most debug logging (will spam the console but excludes logging that is extremely verbose and usually not helpful)
# - 3 (or higher): All debug logging (will spam the console)
#
