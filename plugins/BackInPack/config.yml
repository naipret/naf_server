database: false

# How MySQL works.
# The database can perform not only the function of storing files, but also synchronizing backpacks between servers.
#
# Possible options to choose from:
# data - sends data to the database and stores it there
# sync - works the same as "data", but additionally synchronizes backpacks from the database between servers
database-type: data

# How to use the sync option:
# * You need two servers with the same version of the plugin.
# * Connect the plugin to the same database.
# * In "database-type" type "sync" in both configurations.
# * Restart the servers.
# * Ready!
#
# IMPORTANT! The "sync" option does not modify the inventories.yml file in any way.
# The file with this option will not be used.
# IMPORTANT! The sync option can significantly slow down the performance of the plugin.
